# HSR Twitterverse

The HSR Twitterverse (HT) aggregates the Twitter feeds of students and alumni of the [University of Applied Sciences in Rapperswil, Switzerland](http://www.hsr.ch) (HSR).

This is the new implementation of the currently deployed HSR Twitterverse at http://twitter.planet-hsr.ch, which is written in PHP; the latter will be replaced by this Python version as soon as possible.

The HSR Twitterverse is powered by [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) (Python microframework), and uses the awesome [Universal Feed Parser](http://feedparser.org). Also, this is my very first little project written in Python. 

##TODO

 * Replace `SimpleCache` with Redis or Memcached
